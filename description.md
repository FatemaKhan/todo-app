## introduction
As a result of the pandemic forcing U.S. employers to allow large-scale remote work, an estimated 75 million people have worked from home over the past year. Under the remote working model, the productivity of some employees will be affected to some extent. The comfort of home makes it difficult for some people to concentrate. Additionally, by concentrating on high-value tasks, you accomplish more. Prioritizing the items on your to-do list is considerably simpler once you have one. By doing this, you may be sure that you're always working on the proper things. Otherwise, it's simple to get stuck doing whatever looks most necessary or convenient. 

This could result in you putting off crucial tasks that don't need your immediate attention. To put it simply, making a to-do list is a planning process. Planning, in turn, enables the transformation of illogical objectives into specific course of action. By breaking down your goals and knowing what you should be doing at any given moment, you can reduce tension. It's a good strategy to increase your chances of achieving significant objectives.

An external memory aid: A to-do list helps you remember things better. Only a little amount of information can be held in memory at once. You'll be able to remember all of your obligations rather than just a few of them if you keep a to-do list. Additionally, your to-do list will reinforce the knowledge, reducing the likelihood that you'll forget something.

Enhances productivity: A to-do app allows you to prioritize the things that are most crucial. Thus, you avoid wasting time on activities that don't demand your immediate attention. Your list will assist you in maintaining focus on the tasks that are most crucial.

Boosts motivation: Because you can use to-do lists to define your objectives, they are excellent motivational tools. Your confidence will grow as you cross each item off your list of short-term goals, which you can use to break down your long-term goal into smaller, more manageable chunks.
